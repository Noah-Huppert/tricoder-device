# Overview
Uses my  [Mbed Lidar Lite driver](https://github.com/Noah-Huppert/mbed-lidar-lite-driver)
and my [CCS811 air quality driver](https://github.com/Noah-Huppert/mbed-ccs811-air-quality-driver)
to display ranging or air quality information on an LCD display.  

This was a small project for a computer science course, I choose to take two 
devices I currently owned and write drivers for them in the Mbed platform. In 
an lite attempt to emulate the Star Trek tricoder.

This code was run on a LPC1768.
